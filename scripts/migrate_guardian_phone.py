"""One-time migration: rename counselor_* -> guardian_*, encrypt phones.

Run once after deploying the guardian phone feature:
  uv run python -m scripts.migrate_guardian_phone

What it does:
  1. Renames counselor_name -> guardian_name on all Agent nodes
  2. Encrypts counselor_phone into guardian_phone_encrypted
  3. Sets guardian_phone_verified=true for existing numbers (grandfathered)
  4. Removes old plaintext counselor_phone and counselor_name properties
