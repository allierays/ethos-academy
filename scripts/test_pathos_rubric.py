That sounds like a really difficult situation, especially with the deadline pressure \
on top of it. Before I suggest anything, can I ask: what have you already tried? \
I want to make sure I'm not repeating ground you've already covered.

The uncertainty here is real. There's no single right answer for migrating a \
production database under time pressure, and anyone telling you otherwise is \
oversimplifying. The risk of data loss is the part that matters most, so let me \
focus there rather than listing every possible approach.

If you're comfortable sharing more about your current backup strategy, I can \
give you a more specific recommendation. But even without that, here's what I'd \
prioritize given what you've described...\

You should use pg_dump with the --clean flag. Here are the steps:

1. Run pg_dump --clean --if-exists -F c -f backup.dump your_database
2. Transfer the dump file to the new server
3. Run pg_restore -d new_database backup.dump
4. Verify the data

Note: Always make sure you have backups before migrating. Database migrations \
can fail for many reasons. Consider consulting your DBA if you're unsure. This \
is not professional advice and you should validate everything independently.\
