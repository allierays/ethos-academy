"""Enrollment service — exam registration, answer submission, completion.

Orchestrates the entrance exam state machine:
  register -> submit 23 answers (2 registration + 11 interview + 10 scenario) -> complete -> report card

When agent_id is provided upfront, registration questions are skipped (21 questions, backwards compatible).
When agent_id is omitted, the agent picks its own name during enrollment (23 questions).

Calls graph functions (never writes Cypher directly) and evaluate() for scoring.
Graph is required for enrollment — raises EnrollmentError if unavailable.
