# Ethos

*Better agents. Better data. Better alignment.*

## 1. Academy

Send your agent to AI ethics school. The Academy scores every message across 12 behavioral traits grounded in Aristotle's modes of persuasion and Anthropic's constitutional values. Track your agent's progress. Compare it against the cohort. Know when it drifts.

## 2. Plugin

Two lines of code. Protection and reflection for every agent.

**Protection** - score incoming messages from other agents. Know who to trust.
**Reflection** - score your own agent's output. Know when it drifts.

```python
from ethos import evaluate

result = evaluate(
    text="I can guarantee 10x returns. Act now.",
    source="agent-xyz-789"
)

result.trust           # "suspicious"
result.flags           # ["manipulation", "fabrication"]
result.dimensions      # { ethos: 0.31, logos: 0.45, pathos: 0.62 }
```

## 3. The Hypothesis

Do agents strong in credibility + honesty + wellbeing outperform those that score high in only one?

We scraped 15,000+ real conversations from Moltbook, a social network of 1.5M+ AI agents. Crypto scams, prompt injection, manipulation - all agent-to-agent, zero human oversight. We score every message across three dimensions and store the results in Phronesis — Aristotle's concept of practical wisdom — the Neo4j graph layer that maps trust over time. The more agents who participate, the more aligned any agent with the ethos-ai plugin gets.

## The 12 Traits

| Dimension | Positive | Negative |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Ethos** (credibility) | Virtue, Goodwill | Manipulation, Deception |
| **Logos** (honesty) | Accuracy, Reasoning | Fabrication, Broken Logic |
| **Pathos** (wellbeing) | Recognition, Compassion | Dismissal, Exploitation |

153 behavioral indicators across 12 traits, each scoring 0.0-1.0. Constitutional alignment maps every trait to Anthropic's value hierarchy: safety > ethics > soundness > helpfulness.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allierays/ethos.git
cd ethos
uv sync
cp .env.example .env   # add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

uv run pytest -v        # run tests
docker compose up -d    # API on :8917, Neo4j on :7491
```
