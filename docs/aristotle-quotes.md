These are **NOT** from Aristotle's surviving works:

- **"Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all."**
  No trace in Aristotle's works.

- **"Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom."**
  Associated with the Delphic maxim "Know thyself," not Aristotle.

- **"No great mind has ever existed without a touch of madness."**
  Derives from Seneca, not Aristotle's extant texts.

- **"Tolerance and apathy are the last virtues of a dying society."**
