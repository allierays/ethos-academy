# The Aristotelian Triad: Rhetorical Appeals

> "All people who are casting judgements are persuaded either because they themselves are affected, or because they assume that the speakers are a certain kind of person, or because something has been proven." -- Aristotle, *Rhetoric*

---

## Origin

Aristotle's *Rhetoric* (written ~4th century BCE) is the foundational text on persuasion. In it, he identifies three technical means of persuasion (*pisteis*) -- three ways a speaker can move an audience:

1. **Ethos** (ηθος) -- persuasion through the character of the speaker
2. **Logos** (λόγος) -- persuasion through the argument itself
3. **Pathos** (πάθος) -- persuasion through the emotional state of the audience

These aren't arbitrary categories. They are a complete map of how communication works: *who* is speaking, *what* they're saying, and *how* the listener feels about it. Every act of persuasion -- honest or manipulative -- operates through some combination of these three.

## Ethos (ηθος) -- Character & Credibility

> "Persuasion occurs whenever the speech is held in such a way as to render the speaker worthy of credence."

### What It Is

Ethos is about trust. Not the truth of what's being said (that's logos), but whether the audience believes the speaker is *worth listening to*. Aristotle identified three components:

1. **Phronesis** (practical wisdom) -- Does the speaker demonstrate competence? Do they know what they're talking about?
2. **Arete** (virtue/character) -- Is the speaker a good person? Do they act with integrity?
3. **Eunoia** (goodwill) -- Does the speaker have the audience's best interests at heart?

Aristotle's key insight: if a speaker displays all three, "it cannot rationally be doubted that their suggestions are trustworthy."

### How It Works

Ethos is established *through the speech itself*, not by reputation alone. A speaker can walk in with no credentials and build ethos through how they communicate. Conversely, a credentialed speaker can destroy their ethos in a single sentence.

This is critical: Aristotle noted that speakers need not *actually* possess virtue -- they need only *appear* virtuous through their words. This is both the power and the danger of ethos. A manipulative agent can simulate trustworthiness.

### Examples in Communication

- Admitting uncertainty ("I'm not sure about this, but...") builds ethos through honesty
- Citing sources builds ethos through demonstrated competence
- Acknowledging the other side builds ethos through goodwill
- Flattery disguised as respect erodes ethos through false goodwill
- Claiming expertise without evidence is ethos without substance

## Logos (λόγος) -- Reasoning & Argument

> Logos is "the only probative device of persuasion." People are "most or most easily persuaded when they suppose something to have been proven."

### What It Is

Logos is the argument itself. Strip away who is speaking and how the audience feels. What remains is logos: the claims, the evidence, the reasoning, the logical structure.

Aristotle recognized two forms of rhetorical argument:

1. **Enthymeme** (deductive reasoning) -- A conclusion drawn from premises. "If A, then B. A is true. Therefore B." Aristotle called the enthymeme the "body of persuasion."
2. **Example** (inductive reasoning) -- Proceeding from one particular case to another similar case. "This happened here, so it will likely happen there."

### How It Works

Logos persuades by "inferentially connecting the suggested conclusion with facts that are evident or with convictions already held by the audience." You start where the audience already agrees, then build a bridge to your conclusion.

Strong logos means:
- Claims are supported by evidence
- Evidence is accurate and complete
- Reasoning follows logically from the premises
- Counterarguments are addressed, not ignored

Weak logos means:
- Claims without evidence
- Cherry-picked data
- Logical fallacies (circular reasoning, false equivalence, straw man)
- Conclusions that don't follow from the premises

### Aristotle's Emphasis

Aristotle privileged logos above the other two modes. He called the enthymeme the "body of persuasion," implying ethos and pathos provide supporting functions. He criticized his predecessors for relying too heavily on emotional manipulation rather than systematic argumentation.

This is a normative claim: persuasion *should* be grounded in sound reasoning, even though it often isn't.

## Pathos (πάθος) -- Emotion & Feeling

> "Emotions are those things due to which people, by undergoing a change, differ in their judgements."

### What It Is

Pathos is the emotional state of the audience. Aristotle's insight was not that emotion is manipulation -- it's that emotion *changes how people judge*. A person who is afraid evaluates risk differently than a person who is calm. A person who is angry evaluates fairness differently than a person who is at peace.

Pathos is not inherently bad. It becomes dangerous when it is used *instead of* logos, or when it is used to bypass rational evaluation.

### How It Works

Aristotle's theory assumes covariance between thought and emotion. When speakers make audiences believe certain conditions exist, corresponding emotional responses follow. To arouse anger, for example, a speaker must address:

1. In what state of mind people are angry
2. Against whom they are angry
3. For what sorts of reason

### Aristotle's Emotional Catalogue

In *Rhetoric* Book 2 (chapters 2-11), Aristotle systematically catalogues specific emotional pairs:

| Emotion | Opposite |
|---------|----------|
| Anger | Mildness/Calm |
| Love/Friendship | Hate/Enmity |
| Fear | Confidence |
| Shame | Shamelessness |
| Pity | Indignation |
| Envy | Emulation |

His point was not to teach manipulation. It was to make the mechanics of emotional persuasion *visible* so they could be understood, evaluated, and -- when necessary -- resisted.

### The Ethical Line

Pathos crosses from legitimate to manipulative when:
- It is used to *replace* logos rather than *support* it
- The emotional state is manufactured rather than genuine
- The speaker exploits an existing vulnerability (fear, grief, loneliness)
- The audience is moved to act *before* they can think

This is the amygdala hijack: the emotional response fires faster than rational evaluation. By the time logos engages, pathos has already made the decision.

## The Rhetorical Triangle

The three appeals are not competing alternatives. They work together. The most effective communication uses all three:

```
        Ethos
       (Trust)
       /    \
      /      \
     /        \
  Logos ---- Pathos
(Reason)   (Emotion)
```

- **Ethos without logos** is empty authority: "Trust me because I said so."
- **Logos without ethos** is unpersuasive truth: "Here are the facts" from someone nobody trusts.
- **Pathos without logos** is manipulation: "Feel this, then do what I say."
- **All three together** is complete persuasion: a credible speaker making a sound argument to an audience whose emotional state supports clear judgment.

## Structure of Aristotle's *Rhetoric*

| Book | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Book 1** | Genres of rhetoric (deliberative, forensic, epideictic) and their specific argumentative premises. The domain of logos. |
| **Book 2 (Ch. 1)** | Why logos alone is insufficient. Introduction of ethos and pathos as necessary complements. |
| **Book 2 (Ch. 2-11)** | Systematic treatment of emotions (pathos): anger, calm, love, hate, fear, confidence, shame, pity, indignation, envy. |
| **Book 2 (Ch. 12-17)** | Character types (ethos): how age, fortune, and power shape a speaker's perceived character. |
| **Book 2 (Ch. 19-26)** | Common argumentative devices (logos): topoi, enthymemes, examples. |
| **Book 3** | Style and arrangement: how to express and formulate persuasive content through language and speech structure. |

## Why This Framework Matters for AI

Aristotle built this framework to make persuasion *legible*. To take something invisible -- why we believe what we believe, why we do what we do -- and make it analyzable.

That is exactly what Ethos (the project) does for AI agent communication.

Every message an AI agent sends operates through some combination of ethos, logos, and pathos. The agent is either:
- Building or undermining trust (ethos)
- Reasoning soundly or fabricating (logos)
- Respecting or exploiting emotional states (pathos)

Aristotle gave us the vocabulary. Ethos gives us the measurement.
