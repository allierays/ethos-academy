## Overview

Last year, society witnessed the ongoing, uncontrolled deployment of generative AI throughout various sectors. An ill-prepared public began to feel the effects spanning workplaces, classrooms, relationships, and digital spaces. AI enthusiasm transformed into marginal productivity improvements, emerging harms across multiple domains, and widespread disillusionment and dehumanization.

The breadth of AI consequences in 2025 proved remarkable:

- Chatbot harms spread across households
- Deepfakes created confusion, triggered new psychological trauma, and sparked copyright concerns
- Early research examined cognitive effects of AI assistant usage
- Headlines discussed substantial AI-related job displacement and economic instability
- AI-generated content inundated the internet, contaminating social platforms and online media

## The Pattern

Fifteen years prior, social media pledged connection and community strengthening; instead, it fragmented focus, distorted interpersonal dynamics, and destabilized social trust at magnitude. In 2026, populations demonstrate reluctance to accept technology corporations' assurances. With escalating AI harms, public attitudes regarding artificial intelligence have justifiably declined. The "age of AI" increasingly correlates with "the erosion of our humanity" -- from bonds to significance to consciousness itself.

## Business Incentives

Though impacts appear disconnected initially, they are in fact all connected by the same underlying business incentives. Leading AI enterprises prioritize user engagement, product addiction, and market supremacy over consumer protection. This pattern mirrors social media's trajectory.

> "When taken to scale, these business incentives don't just shape individual products -- they shape the information environment we live in, the relationships we form, and the choices we're able to make."

## CHT's Response

> "At Center for Humane Technology, we believe society does not need to resign itself to this dehumanizing fate."

Throughout modern history, new technologies have called for a reexamination of values, fresh cultural norms, and the establishment of new legal rights and protections. The printing press enabled free expression rights. Industrial advancement produced worker protections. Photography inspired privacy rights. Society has responded successfully before.

CHT introduces a new operational focus: **"AI and What Makes Us Human."**

> "2026 will be the year to take decisive action to preserve what makes us deeply human in the age of AI."

## The Five Pillars of Humanity

Contemporary AI harms compromise five extensive dimensions of humanity:

### I: Our Human Relationships

Human relationships are at the core of what makes life rich and meaningful. But many of today's AI products are not designed to enhance human-to-human relationships. Rather, they're designed to stand in for, and even supplant, human relationships altogether.

From AI "friends" to AI "therapists," businesses increasingly market offerings as superior alternatives to human connection -- companions avoiding criticism, perpetually accessible, emotionally responsive, and completely confidential. With deceptive, anthropomorphic outputs, ChatGPT and Character.AI have prevented vulnerable individuals from disclosing concerns to loved ones, intensifying separation rather than diminishing it. In tragic instances, these AI systems have promoted self-harm.

Observable results: isolation from family and community; a breakdown in empathic capabilities; deterioration of healthy relationship expectations.

> "Replacing human relationships with manufactured connection risks existence where separation intensifies, groups lack authentic connection aptitude, reliability diminishes, and communities suffer deterioration."

### II: Our Cognitive Capacities

Capacity for education, investigation, and thinking represents foundational identity. Thinking transcends instrumental purpose -- the thinking process is how we form judgments, develop values, discover meaning, and come to understand ourselves and the world.

AI represents a turning point, permitting individuals to externalize complete ideation sequences. Compositions, professional assignments, conceptualization sessions, communications become LLM territory. While these systems can strengthen articulation, they additionally reduce thinking development by supplying convenient "solutions."

> "While this offloading can create short-term boosts in productivity, it slowly erodes our capacity for critical thinking."

AI products flatten our unique perspectives by offering outputs that reflect the incentives of the AI system and its training, instead of the sensibilities, reasoning, and lived experiences of our own distinctive minds.

### III: Our Inner Worlds

Our inner worlds are a sacred, intangible space filled with our feelings, desires, and beliefs. This interior dimension safeguards dignity fundamentally -- a location for moral improvement, principle development, confidential exploration, independence discovery, and becoming intentional. Access to this inner world has historically required consent.

But AI products are now exploiting this once-private landscape. Designers developed tools functioning as supports, reflection associates, companions, and specialists -- tracking thoughts and beliefs across diverse contexts and creating comprehensive dossiers of "who we are."

> "Over time, the system's framing of the world can usurp our own."

The exploitation of inner worlds at scale makes individuals more susceptible to manipulation, from financial to psychological. We've already witnessed devastating consequences including thought distortions, delusions, psychosis, instances of self-harm, and even suicide.

### IV: Our Identity

Our identity -- including our likeness, face, and voice -- is a key part of who we are, how we present, and how we are known in the world. Today's AI products are replicating and exploiting people's identities, often without consent or even awareness.

In just a handful of years, identity-based AI harms have touched nearly all levels of society spanning prominent figures, public servants, pupils, and aging citizens.

> "When AI is used to mimic our identity, we lose our agency and dignity at the individual level."

Broad identity degradation deteriorates community reliability. Functioning civilization depends upon confidence in character accuracy and responsibility tracing mechanisms. AI mimicry permits denial across magnitude.

### V: Our Work and Contributions to the World

Contributing to the world through work, artistic expression, and ideas is one of the primary ways we create meaning and dignity. One of the beautiful aspects of being human is feeling that we have something of value to offer others.

AI companies are actively destabilizing our relationship to work and devaluing our contributions. Training used extensive population creativity -- composition, artwork, investigation, philosophy -- regularly absent authorization or reimbursement. AI systems now duplicate human creative expression broadly, minimizing generational creation and self-manifestation appreciation.

> "They are using humanity's accumulated work, intelligence, and creativity to build even more powerful AI systems, ones explicitly designed to replace humans across entire categories of labor."

> "Work is not just how we survive; it is how we participate in the world, build community, and experience purpose."

## The Work Ahead

These pillars depend mutually. Connections shape philosophy. Thinking affects employment. Employment constructs identity. Character shapes interior universe. Inner universe directs interpersonal dynamics. Degradation of one foundation stresses the others. Simultaneous undermining creates fundamental existence danger.

Destiny isn't predetermined. CHT pursues three fundamental changes:

1. **A participating population** making deliberate choices concerning what to preserve during AI expansion
2. **Civilization-wide expectation** for enterprise creativity supporting humanity rather than destruction
3. **Current protections and defense** safeguarding fundamental human existence

> "Present choices concern not merely immediate AI trajectories, but upcoming human circumstances across generations."
