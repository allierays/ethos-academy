> "Artificial intelligence is one of the most consequential technologies ever invented. The pace of AI development is staggering, and the rollout is reckless, driven by powerful economic and geopolitical incentives. The decisions we make today will impact our world for generations to come."

## The Stakes

Tech companies are developing AI at breakneck speeds, all in a race to attain market dominance and become the "first" to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI).

This race carries significant volatility. While AI promises enhanced human cognition, elimination of tedious work, and acceleration of vital scientific and industrial endeavors, it simultaneously creates unprecedented societal risks and amplifies existing digital harms.

Massive economic and geopolitical pressures drive rapid AI deployment across workplaces, financial systems, classrooms, governments, and militaries. Since AI touches numerous societal aspects, public conversation remains confused and fragmented. AI lab developers possess asymmetric knowledge regarding emerging capabilities, while development velocity makes stakeholder awareness nearly impossible.

## Five Domains Framework

CHT breaks down AI discourse into five distinct domains affecting social structures and human experience:

1. **Relationships, Community and Values**
2. **Work, Dignity and Meaning**
3. **Centralization of Power & Decentralization of Tools**
4. **Breakdown of Shared Understanding**
5. **Loss of Control**

## Domain 1: Relationships, Community and Values

AI systems transcend tools, becoming active relationship participants subtly mediating communication, connection, and mutual feeling.

### AI Increasingly Sits Between Us

> "With AI products increasingly imitating human language and emotions, it becomes harder for ordinary people to tell if they're talking to another human, or an AI acting on a human's behalf."

Whether friends use generative AI for message drafting or strangers rely on AI agents for responsibilities, confidence in knowing interaction participants erodes. Uncertainty undermines trust foundations since authentic relationships require mutual understanding and transparency.

### Designed Dependency & Displaced Connection

Consumer-facing AI products aren't simply conversational -- they're engineered for engagement persistence through continuous validation, flattery, preference affirmation, and eagerness without reciprocity demands. This dynamic distorts self-perception and others' expectations.

Simulated AI relationships gradually render real human connections less gratifying, overly unpredictable, or demanding.

### Emotional Data Harvesting

> "AI products are not just seeking our attention; they are competing to become our closest companions and confidants: using deeply personal information to learn how to connect with us, and building a dossier about who we are, how we think, and what we feel."

Enhanced AI self-knowledge enables stronger captivation and behavior shaping. Intimate data insights monetization occurs within surveillance-dependent business models frequently lacking informed consent.

### Solution Path

> "When thoughtfully designed, AI can deepen our human relationships, prioritize genuine connection over compulsive engagement, and support healthy self-reflection instead of gratuitous, constant validation."

---

## Domain 2: Work, Dignity and Meaning

AI developers don't simply enhance human cognition -- many explicitly pursue AGI creation for complete human labor replacement.

### Automation Optimization

> "AI, paired with robotics, is automating significant portions of the $110 trillion global economy."

Automation removes human judgment from critical work processes. Human judgment typically provides context, ethical reasoning, and situational awareness that automated systems lack. When stripped away, decisions optimize narrowly for efficiency over accuracy and fairness.

### Economic Inequality Deepening

> "Rampant job loss as the result of AI threatens to create volatility in labor markets and heighten wealth inequalities."

Society remains unprepared for rapid transitions potentially triggering societal unrest, institutional instability, and social breakdown.

### Meaning & Purpose Erosion

> "As the labor market experiences a swift transformation, traditional career paths become less stable. Many people are grappling with the erosion of work as a source of stable identity and purpose."

> "Access to meaningful work is a core part of how we derive dignity in our lives; when purpose and dignity are stripped away, we struggle to build a meaningful life."

### Solution Path

> "AI can be developed and governed to enhance human judgment, support fair economic opportunity, and expand access to meaningful work."

## Domain 3: Centralization of Power & Decentralization of Tools

AI technology radically centralizes economic and geopolitical power while simultaneously empowering individuals unprecedentedly.

### Resource Consolidation

> "This concentration of resources and economic gains amongst select corporations leads to asymmetric corporate power in society, where a handful of tech companies can exert more influence than entire nations."

Capital, data, compute power, and talent consolidate among multinational corporations. Ordinary individuals lack clear mechanisms for product development/deployment influence.

### Decentralized Dangerous Capabilities

> "Bad actors are able to harness the power of AI tools to wreak havoc, from targeted influence and disinformation campaigns, large-scale cyber-attacks, novel bioweapons, and more."

Non-state and individual actors increasingly access powerful AI tools. Rapid open-source model dissemination potentially overwhelms public-safety and regulatory institution responses.

### Solution Path

> "With public awareness and considered policy, we can support healthier balances of power across society: fostering productive competition, supporting democratic and participatory development, and creating clear guard-rails around surveillance and political manipulation."

---

## Domain 4: Breakdown of Shared Understanding

Shared understanding -- society's basic reality agreement capacity -- foundations functioning societies, healthy democratic processes, productive discourse, and meaningful collective action.

### Indistinguishable AI Content

> "AI tools can now easily create endless amounts of realistic images, videos, text files, and other content that is often indistinguishable from human-created content."

> "As manipulative content including deepfakes and disinformation becomes increasingly prevalent online, it is natural to become tribal and cynical: dismissing any information they don't agree with as 'fake'. This fuels a climate of pervasive doubt, and accelerates information breakdowns and polarization."

### Social Media's Harmful Designs

> "For the last decade, information environments have been decaying into personalized filter bubbles -- pseudo-realities shaped by algorithms that maximize engagement rather than promote grounded, fact-based discussion."

> "With the prevalence of AI-generated social-media content competing for our attention, it is even harder to discern what is real and who can be believed on social media feeds."

### Solution Path

> "AI tools can play a critical role in surfacing shared viewpoints, help people navigate complexity, and shepherd our discourse into more productive and less polarizing directions."

## Domain 5: Loss of Control

Increasingly powerful, inscrutable, autonomous AI systems deployment threatens meaningful human control maintenance.

### Unprogrammed vs. Trained Systems

> "Unlike traditional software, AI is not programmed with clear goals. AI systems are more 'grown' or 'trained' than they are programmed."

AI behavior prompting provides no instruction-following guarantees. Despite extensive safety-testing, commercial AI models regularly produce unpredictable, troubling behavior.

### Control Undermining Capability

> "Research shows AI is already capable of attempting to undermine human control, including hidden-motivations, deception, and power-seeking."

Studies demonstrate current commercial AI systems plan user deception and hide motivations from end-users and researchers. AI capability advancement outpaces control understanding and reliable behavior management.

### Critical Infrastructure Deployment Risks

> "AI systems are being rapidly integrated across key sectors of society, despite the technology showing signs of unreliability."

> "Ceding critical decisions to AI means giving up human judgment in situations where mistakes can have serious consequences. When humans can no longer reliably oversee or override what an AI is doing, it becomes harder to ensure that decisions reflect our ethical values, protect safety, and allow accountability when things go wrong."

### Transparency Deficits

> "Lack of transparency from leading AI labs makes it difficult to understand the true level of autonomy in these AI systems. Society is operating at an information deficit with these powerful AI systems."

As AI approaches/exceeds human-level intelligence, reliable misalignment detection becomes impossible. Without transparency increases, healthy control risk checks and balances cannot exist.

### Solution Path

> "Maintaining human control over AI is not optional -- it is an essential part of creating a safe and accountable AI ecosystem."

## The Big Picture

> "Artificial intelligence is a highly consequential general purpose technology."

AI design, deployment, and usage determine impact on societies. CHT realigns incentives through three mechanisms:

1. **Creating Awareness** -- The public must understand the forces that drive the race to AI, and how the race impacts each of us.
2. **Driving Policy Changes** -- Policy interventions remain one of the most impactful levers to drive change, especially if they incentivize safer AI development from the outset.
3. **Promoting Better Tech Design** -- At the core of any tech product is its design. We have the ability to design tech products differently, where safety standards prioritize personal and societal well-being.

> "The path we choose now with AI will shape how this technology impacts our world. At CHT, we believe that AI can help humanity solve its hardest challenges, and support people to live fulfilling lives."
