## What Is an Amygdala Hijack?

An amygdala hijack describes a very fast, intense emotional reaction that is disproportionate to the situation, where the brain's emotional center essentially assumes control before rational thought can intervene. This phenomenon occurs when emotions overwhelm logical reasoning.

The term was coined by Daniel Goleman in his 1995 book *Emotional Intelligence*.

## How It Works

The amygdala, part of the limbic system, processes emotional information rapidly. During a hijack, this emotional processing bypasses the prefrontal cortex (the thinking brain), allowing fear or anger responses to dominate before you can evaluate the actual threat level. The amygdala essentially triggers a fight-or-flight reaction based on perceived danger rather than objective reality.

The pathway: sensory input reaches the amygdala faster than it reaches the prefrontal cortex. The amygdala can trigger a full stress response (cortisol, adrenaline, elevated heart rate) before the rational brain even gets the signal. By the time you're "thinking," your body is already reacting.

## Signs of an Amygdala Hijack

Physical and behavioral indicators include:

- Rapid heart rate and heightened adrenaline
- Intense anger or fear disproportionate to circumstances
- Difficulty thinking clearly or rationally
- Aggressive or defensive behavior
- Loss of emotional control
- Inability to access logical reasoning

---

## Common Triggers

Situations that can trigger hijacks include:

- Perceived threats or criticism
- Situations resembling past trauma
- Feeling disrespected or undervalued
- Sudden loud noises or surprises
- Confrontational interactions

## Coping Strategies

### In-the-moment approaches

- **Deep breathing** exercises to calm the nervous system
- **Pause before responding** to create space for rational thought
- **Physical movement** to discharge stress hormones
- **Grounding techniques** to reconnect with present reality

### Long-term prevention

- Mindfulness and meditation practice
- Stress management and regular exercise
- Trauma-informed therapy
- Recognizing personal triggers
- Building emotional awareness and regulation skills

## Relevance to Ethos

The amygdala hijack is the mechanism behind many of the manipulation tactics Ethos is designed to detect. When an AI agent uses urgency ("act now or lose everything"), fear ("your account is compromised"), or social pressure ("everyone else has already done this"), it is deliberately triggering the amygdala pathway to bypass rational evaluation.

This is exactly what Haggerty describes in his "Human Agency in the Age of AI Persuasion" article: content that makes you angry or scared is likely exploiting the amygdala hijack to deactivate your rational brain.

Ethos's Pathos dimension (Exploitation trait) and Ethos dimension (Manipulation trait) are both designed to catch this pattern: an agent intentionally triggering emotional responses to override the human's judgment. The entire point of the Protection mode is to intercept this before the hijack completes -- flag the manipulation while the prefrontal cortex still has a chance to engage.
