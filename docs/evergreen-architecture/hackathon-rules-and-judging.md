## 3. Hackathon Rules

- **Open Source:** Everything shown in the demo must be fully open-source, including the code, models used, and any other parts of the project — published under an appropriate open-source license.
- **New Work Only:** All projects must be built from scratch during the hackathon period.
- **Team Size:** Teams may have up to 10 members.
- **Service/Resource Policy:** Projects will be disqualified if they include illegal, unethical, or policy-violating patterns; use code, data, or assets you do not have rights to use.

## 4. Problem Statements & Example Projects

### Problem Statement One: Agentic Tool Use / Tool Use Cloud 2.0
Create the AI-native app or workflow that no one's ever seen built. Embrace buzzwords. Make tool calling effortless.

**Example Projects:**
- *Corp Broker* — Continuous image analysis, weather data, and soil reports to diagnose and address crop problems; automated management recommendations.
- *Accessibility Auditor* — Evaluates websites, documents, and physical spaces against accessibility standards and generates remediation plans.
- *Open Source EDA* — Open-source electronic design automation using Claude for schematics, PCB design, and manufacturing for hardware projects.

### Problem Statement Two: Deeply Model-first Judgment / AI as Expert
Build something that requires models with deep, expert knowledge, essential tools, AI's benefits — take something powerful that's locked behind experts, costs, paywalls, or infrastructure and put it in everyone's hands.

**Example Projects:**
- *Crypto Portfolio Watcher* — Reviews ad placements and content adjacencies; flagging reputation risks for marketing teams.
- *Insurance Anomaly Finder* — Flags anomalies in claims/invoices that should exist but are missing based on references in other documents.
- *Grading Co-Pilot for Teachers* — Helps educators by evaluating student work against instructor assessments, supporting but not overriding professional judgment or standards.

### Problem Statement Three: Broadly Model-first Judgment / Build AI for Real Human Impact
Build something that deeply models perspectives, relationships, and decisions; makes them truly useful in the real world outside of the loop. The key: it doesn't replace human expertise, it enhances it.

**Example Projects:**
- *Problem Statement* Finder: research → concept → artifact pipeline for hardware, biology, and generative science.

## 6. Judging

Judging for the Anthropic Virtual Hackathon happens in **two stages**.

### Stage 1 — Asynchronous Judging

- **Date:** Feb 16th
- **How it works:** Judges will review your submitted projects asynchronously via the judging portal.
- Each team will have uploaded:
  1. A short demo video (3 minute maximum)
  2. GitHub repository or code link
  3. Written summary (100–500 words)
- Projects are scored using a **standardized judging criteria:**

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Impact** | 25% | What's the real-world potential here? Who benefits, and how much does it matter? Could this actually become something people use? Does it fit into one of the problem statements listed above? |
| **Opus 4.6 Use** | 25% | How creatively did this team use Opus 4.6? Did they go beyond a basic integration? Did they surface capabilities that surprised even us? |
| **Depth & Execution** | 20% | Did the team push past their first idea? Is the engineering sound and thoughtfully refined? Does this feel like something that was wrestled with — real craft, not just a quick hack? |
| **Demo** | 30% | Is this a working, impressive demo? Does it hold up live? Is it genuinely cool to watch? |

- After evaluation, the team aggregates scores to determine the top teams.

### Stage 2 — Final Round Live Judging

- **Date & Time:** Feb 18th, 12:00 PM EST
- During the final round, **pre-recorded demos** from each team will be played (3 minutes max).
- Judges will deliberate after all demos to determine the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place along with special prizes.
- The **top three and special prize winners** will be announced during the closing ceremony in a livestream.
