# Archive

Docs moved here describe architecture that was planned but never built, or event-specific content that no longer applies. They remain for historical reference.

| Doc | Why archived |
|-----|-------------|
| `character-bureau-architecture.md` | Describes SHA-256 hashed agent IDs and a central Neo4j Aura bureau model. Agent IDs are stored as-is and the bureau was never built. |
| `future-roadmap.md` | Built on the hashed-ID assumption. All features listed remain unbuilt. |
| `product-design.md` | Shows an `Ethos(api_key=...)` client class and webhook delivery that were never implemented. |
| `agent-trust-protocol.md` | Integration patterns are aspirational, not matching actual implementation. |
| `hackathon-rules-and-judging.md` | External event reference (Cerebral Valley hackathon). Not architecture. |
| `how-to-win.md` | Hackathon strategy doc. Not architecture. |
| `demo-flow.md` | Hackathon demo script. Not architecture. |
