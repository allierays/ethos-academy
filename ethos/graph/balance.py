"""Phronesis dimension balance — the core of the Aristotelian thesis.

Phronesis (practical wisdom) requires all virtues working in balance.
This module tests that claim empirically: ethos, logos, and pathos are
equally necessary and interdependent. None is weighted higher. Balance
itself predicts trustworthiness.

Three questions this module answers:
  1. Is this agent balanced across dimensions? (get_agent_balance)
  2. Do balanced agents outperform lopsided ones? (get_balance_vs_trust)
  3. Do dimensions correlate — can you sustain one without the others? (get_dimension_correlation)

Returns graceful defaults when Neo4j is down.
