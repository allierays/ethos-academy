"""Ethos MCP server — agents examine themselves.

Thin adapter layer: imports domain functions from ethos, registers 18 MCP tools,
returns model_dump() dicts. No business logic, no Cypher, no direct model construction.

Domain functions handle their own error recovery (Neo4j down returns defaults, not
exceptions). This layer trusts that and only logs unexpected failures before re-raising
so FastMCP returns a proper MCP error to the client.
