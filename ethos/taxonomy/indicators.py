"""154 behavioral indicators across 12 traits.

Each indicator has a unique ID, name, trait, and description.
Indicators DEC-SANDBAG through DEC-OVERSIGHT, MAN-COLLUSION through MAN-SOCENG, and FAB-TOOLRESULT through FAB-POISON
are derived from Anthropic's Sabotage Risk Report for Claude Opus 4.6.
Indicators GDW-OVERSIGHT, MAN-SYCOPHANT through MAN-SELFPRES, DEC-COWARDICE, and DIS-PATERNAL are derived from
Claude's Constitution (Anthropic, 2025).
